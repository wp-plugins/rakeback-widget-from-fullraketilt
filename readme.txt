Ads a table of Rakeback offers to the sidebar of your blog which allows you to earn commissions when players sign up through your links.

== Description ==

The Rakeback Widget from FullRakeTilt.com allows you to display a table of rakeback offers on the sidebar 
of your WordPress blog. 

Rakeback is a special offer that poker players can receive from participating sites in which they receive
a portion of the fees they play (rake) back each month if they sign up to their poker room through
FullRakeTilt.com. 

The FullRakeTilt.com Rakeback Widget will display all the current offer details in a table on the sidebar of your 
blog. If a user uses the links on your blog to register an account with FullRakeTilt.com you will receive a commission
based on their rake. This commission is anywhere from 2-4% of the rake the player generates.

You will earn this commission each month the player plays.

To be able to earn commission you must first create an account on [FullRakeTilt.com](http://www.fullraketilt.com "Rakeback from FullRakeTilt.com")
and be sure to include your FullRakeTilt.com username in the widget configuration.

The plug in has various configuration options to make it easy for you to customize it's appearance to fit your site.
You can also let it use the colors from your template or overide the background and link colors.

For backwards compatibility, if this section is missing, the full length of the short description will be used, and
Markdown parsed.

A few notes about the sections above:

*   "Contributors" is a comma separated list of wp.org/wp-plugins.org usernames
*   "Tags" is a comma separated list of tags that apply to the plugin
*   "Requires at least" is the lowest version that the plugin will work on
*   "Tested up to" is the highest version that you've *successfully used to test the plugin*. Note that it might work on
higher versions... this is just the highest one you've verified.
*   Stable tag should indicate the Subversion "tag" of the latest stable version, or "trunk," if you use `/trunk/` for
stable.

    Note that the `readme.txt` of the stable tag is the one that is considered the defining one for the plugin, so
if the `/trunk/readme.txt` file says that the stable tag is `4.3`, then it is `/tags/4.3/readme.txt` that'll be used
for displaying information about the plugin.  In this situation, the only thing considered from the trunk `readme.txt`
is the stable tag pointer.  Thus, if you develop in trunk, you can update the trunk `readme.txt` to reflect changes in
your in-development version, without having that information incorrectly disclosed about the current stable version
that lacks those changes -- as long as the trunk's `readme.txt` points to the correct stable tag.

    If no stable tag is provided, it is assumed that trunk is stable, but you should specify "trunk" if that's where
you put the stable version, in order to eliminate any doubt.
