The Rakeback Widget from FullRakeTilt.com allows you to display a table of rakeback offers on the sidebar 
of your WordPress blog. 

Rakeback is a special offer that poker players can receive from participating sites in which they receive
a portion of the fees they play (rake) back each month if they sign up to their poker room through
FullRakeTilt.com.

blog. If a user uses the links on your blog to register an account with FullRakeTilt.com you will receive a commission
